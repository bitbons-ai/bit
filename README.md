### Test Coverage
- ✅ Project creation
- ✅ PocketBase operations
- ✅ Docker commands
- ✅ Database management
- ✅ Version control
- ✅ Upgrade process

## Automated Deployment

Our GitHub Actions workflow automates the deployment of your PocketBase backend to fly.io. Here's what it does:

- 🔍 Triggers on pushes to the `main` branch
- 🚢 Deploys only when changes are made to the PocketBase directory
- 🛡️ Uses a secure, revocable deployment token
- 🤖 Completely hands-off deployment process

### Workflow Configuration

```yaml
name: Deploy PocketBase
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - "apps/pb/**"

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: superfly/flyctl-actions/setup-flyctl@master
      - run: flyctl deploy --remote-only
      ```

## Setting Up Deployment Token

1. Generate a fly.io deployment token

```bash
fly tokens create deploy
```

2. Add the token to your GitHub repository:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to Settings → Secrets → Actions
   - Create a new repository secret
   - Name the secret: `FLY_API_TOKEN`
   - Paste the token from fly.io

## Troubleshooting

### Port Conflicts
If you see port conflict errors:
```bash
bit pb stop          # Stop existing PocketBase
bit pb cleanup       # Clean up containers
bit pb start         # Start fresh
```

### Container Issues
For Docker-related issues:
```bash
bit docker cleanup   # Remove problematic containers
bit docker build     # Rebuild image
bit docker up        # Start fresh
```
